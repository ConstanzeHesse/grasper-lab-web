Generally, we are interested in how visual information is used for the planning and guidance of our actions in both real and virtual environments.
Virtual reality is rapidly transforming entertainment and skill training.
We investigate whether people behave similarly in real and virtual environments,
and which information is critical to preserve natural behaviour in VR.
