Our research examines how perceptual properties of food, such as colour, saturation, naturalness, and accessibility influence attention and approach 
behaviour. We explore how these properties shape the way people notice, evaluate, and interact with food. Unlike most studies that use images, we focus on 
real food stimuli to capture behavioural responses that are more representative of real-world choices.
