How do people respond to (un)pleasant touch? This project explores the perceptual and physiological mechanisms behind tactile discomfort — 
with implications for using textures to subtly guide behaviour (e.g., deterring contact with harmful substances).

ERCR-funded: 2023-2026 Open-Research Area (ORA) together with Knut Drewing (JLU Giessen, Germany) and Rochelle Ackerley (Aix-Marseille University, France): "The need for unpleasant touch: 
Behavioural and physiological investigations into negative affective touch and how it can be used to shape interactions."
