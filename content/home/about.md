At the Grasper Lab in Aberdeen, we explore how perception, cognition, and motor systems interact to shape the way we plan and control our actions.

Our research focuses on how visual and cognitive factors influence behaviour, as well as how physical and emotional properties of materials affect our intentions to act.
We use experimental behavioural methods (psychophysics) and occasionally collaborate on neuropsychological studies involving patients with specific visual or spatial 
impairments (such as hemianopia and visual neglect).
