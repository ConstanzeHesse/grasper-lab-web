As part of our joint ora (open-research-area) grant, we (Keith and Constanze) and our German collaborators Prof Knut Drewing and Dr M√ºge Cavdan from Giessen visited 
 Dr Rochelle Ackerley's lab in Marseille. 
<!--more--> 
Rochelle's resarch focusses on the physiological mechanisms underlying the 
perception of unpleasant touch. During our visit, we had the opportunity to test some fascinating equipment, including the stroke machine shown in the image, a thermal cylinder 
capable of rapid heating and cooling, as well
 as seeing (but not trying) the microneurography setup. The trip sparked many exciting ideas for future joint experiments, and we‚Äôre looking forward to launching the next phase of our collaboration later this year.
