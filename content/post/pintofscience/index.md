The Grasper Lab took part in the 2025 **Pint of Science** festival ‚Äî a global celebration of science held not in lecture theatres, but in pubs and cafes!
<!--more--> 
We had a fantastic evening at the **OGV Taproom** in **Newburgh**, a small Aberdeenshire village that proudly hosted one of the UK‚Äôs most rural Pint of Science venues. While 
most of the 408+ events across 45 towns and cities took place in urban centres, Newburgh stood out ‚Äî and proved that curiosity thrives just as strongly outside of big cities.
Our team shared insights into the wonderful world of human perception. The audience got hands-on with a series of **interactive demonstrations**, including a range of classic 
**visual illusions** ‚Äî with the highlight being our portable **Beuchet Chair**, which delighted attendees with its mind-bending effects on perceived body size and scale.
The event sparked fascinating discussions between scientists and the public over a few pints. We are thrilled to have helped bring science closer to 
everyday life, in the most relaxed and memorable setting possible.
Thanks to everyone who came along, asked great questions, and made the night such a success!
