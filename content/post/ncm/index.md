research.

In his poster presentation entitled *"The importance of 3D information in virtual obstacle avoidance: Effects of perceptual uncertainty and feedback"*, Martin shared 
findings a study investigating how people navigate around obstacles in **virtual and augmented reality environments**. The work explored how factors such as contrast and 
illumination influence movement strategies and planning.

Beyond the scientific programme, NCM 2025 offered plenty of opportunities to connect with colleagues from around the world â€” and, in true Panamanian style, to sample 
exceptional local **chocolate** and **rum**. A few wildlife encounters, including the countryâ€™s famously laid-back sloths, made the trip even more memorable.
