## About Me

**Welcome to the Grasper Lab!** We explore how perception, cognition, and the motor system interact to shape the way we plan and control our actions.

My research focuses on how visual and cognitive factors influence motor behaviour, as well as how physical and emotional properties of materials affect our intentions to act.
I primarily use experimental behavioural methods (psychophysics) and occasionally collaborate on neuropsychological studies involving patients with specific visual or spatial impairments (such as hemianopia and visual neglect).
