Giorgia started her PhD degree at the University of Verona in October 2023. Her research focuses 
on rehabilitation in Parkinson’s disease, comparing two cognitive approaches, one targeting executive functions 
and the other memory, and exploring their relationship with motor outcomes and recovery. In September 2025, she joined 
the Grasper Lab for a six-month research stay, where she is developing a project on visuo-perceptual, motor, 
and cognitive processes and their interplay in Parkinson’s disease.
